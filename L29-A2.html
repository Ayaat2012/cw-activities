<!--Promise: A Promise is a special JavaScript object used for asynchronous operations (eg, fetching data, waiting for a task to finish). A promise can be in one of three states:

1. Pending – the initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

2. Fulfilled – the operation completed successfully.

3. Rejected – the operation failed.

async: The async keyword is used before a function to tell JavaScript that the function will return a Promise automatically.

await: The await keyword is used inside an async function to wait for a Promise to finish.-->
