                <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
                <p>
                Dogs are carnivorous mammals belonging to the Carnivora family , and are the most loyal animals to their owners.<br><br>
                About 15,000 years ago, a type of wolf became a domesticated animal by becoming a hunting companion for humans. However, some believe that dogs were domesticated by humans about 100,000 years ago. [ 1 ] However, many sources believe that the domestication of dogs is more recent. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . Wolves and foxes are very closely related to dogs (the wolf is actually the same species). However, since domestication, many different breeds of dogs have been created, ranging from dogs that are only a few inches tall (such as the Chihuahua) to dogs that are three feet tall (such as the Irish Wolfhound)
